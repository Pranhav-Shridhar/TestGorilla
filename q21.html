<!-- What is the role of DOCTYPE in HTML5?


All HTML pages (HTML5 included) need to have their document type declared in the first line of code. DOCTYPE instructs the browser how to interpret the document by indicating what type and version of markup language are being used.

For HTML5 documents, the following DOCTYPE declaration code is used: 

<!DOCTYPE html> -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
