<!-- What is new about the relationship between the <header> and <h1> tags in HTML5?

    
    The <header> tag is used to design the header of a web page and can contain a range of elements including text, logos, or a navigation bar. 
    
    The <h1> tag is the textual part of the header and is used to specify the most important section of a piece of content. Itâ€™s often used alongside other header tags (through to <h6>) to format and prioritize content sections.
