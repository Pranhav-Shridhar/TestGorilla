<!-- What is metadata in HTML5 and how is it specified?


Metadata is data that describes other data, providing additional information about an HTML document. Its purpose is to help browsers, search engines and other web applications better interpret a document. Examples of metadata include the description, author, and keywords.

The <meta> tag is used to define metadata about an HTML document. <meta> tags are always enclosed within the <head> of the HTML document. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Meta Tags Example</title>
    <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, Meta Tags, Metadata" />
    <meta name="description" content="Learning about Meta Tags." />
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>Hello HTML5!</p>
  </body>
</html>
