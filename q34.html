<!-- How can the performance of an HTML5 web page be measured?

Measuring performance is an important step for developers to gauge the competitiveness of their web page and can be achieved using APIs and extensions. Popular solutions include the Navigation Timing API and the User Timing API. 

These tools provide insights into specific performance metrics such as:

Page load speed: The time it takes for the full page to load
Time to interact: The time it takes for the user to be able to interact with the page
Bounce rate: The proportion of users that leave the page without interacting with it
Error rate: The proportion of visits to the page resulting in errors
Conversion rate: The proportion of users that complete a specified action, such as subscribing to a mailing list -->
