<!-- When should <div> tags be used in HTML5?

    
    HTML5 introduces a number of new tags (such as <aside>, <footer>, and <header>) that take the place that <div> has traditionally occupied in previous HTML versions.
    
    However, <div> should still be used in HTML5 when no other semantically appropriate element is available. Generally, this will be for styling purposes, such as wrapping the web page or introducing the opening paragraph.  -->
