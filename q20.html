<!-- How can a copyright symbol be added to the webpage using HTML5?


The ‘&copy’ code is used to generate the copyright symbol (©). As a best practice, it should be accompanied by a year and the name of the organization.

To include copyright information in the footer of a web page, the code would look like this:

<footer> <small>&copy; Copyright Date, Organization Name</small> </footer>  -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <footer><small>&copy; Copyright Date, Organization Name</small></footer>
  </body>
</html>
