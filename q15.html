<!-- What types of graphics are supported by HTML5?


Unlike previous versions, HTML5 offers inbuilt graphics features. The two types of graphics supported by HTML5 are:

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), used to create vector-based graphics, such as diagrams and icons
Canvas, used to draw graphics, such as shapes -->




<!DOCTYPE html>
<body>

    <!-- SVG -->
<svg width="550" height="50" viewBox="0 0 550 50"
		fill="green" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
		<text x="0" y="20">I love GeeksforGeeks</text>
	<svg>

        <!-- Canvas -->

        <canvas id="canvas1" width="400" height="200"
		style="border:2px solid green; border-radius:35px">
