<!-- What are tags in HTML5 and how many are required to make a basic web page? -->

<!-- 
Tags are pieces of HTML5 code used to define the structure of the page. There are more than 100 tags in HTML5, with each one serving a unique purpose, such as positioning text or supporting audio.

In their most basic form, most web pages will need around four tags to get started. These are <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body>. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Title of the document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <button>This is a button!</button>
  </body>
</html>
