<!-- How can HTML5 web pages be optimized?

If a web page is performing poorly, developers have several HTML5 optimization strategies at their disposal:

Compress CPU-intensive assets such as high-resolution images
Bundle code into single files to reduce the number of HTTP requests
Minify code to remove all unnecessary whitespace
Offload operations to the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
Use CSS3 for animations and transitions -->
